# AI Conference Deadlines

A web app to quickly see submission deadlines to top AI conferences, such as NeurIPS and ICLR.

This helps researchers in quickly seeing when to submit their paper.

Note: papers can be submitted at any time to [hf.co/papers](https://hf.co/papers) at [hf.co/papers/submit](https://hf.co/papers/submit), assuming the paper is available on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/).

The benefit of hf.co/papers is that it allows people to quickly find related artifacts, such as models, datasets and demos. See [this paper page](https://huggingface.co/papers/2502.04328) as a nice example - it has 3 models, 1 dataset and 1 demo linked.

## Project info

This project is entirely based on the awesome https://github.com/paperswithcode/ai-deadlines. As that repository is no longer maintained, we decided to make an up-to-date version along with a new UI. It was bootstrapped using [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/) and [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/).

New data is fetched from https://github.com/ccfddl/ccf-deadlines/tree/main/conference/AI thanks to [this comment](https://github.com/paperswithcode/ai-deadlines/issues/723#issuecomment-2603420945). 

A CRON job (set up as a [Github action](.github/workflows/update-conferences.yml)) automatically updates the data present at src/data/conferences.yml.

## Contribute

Contributions are very welcome!

To keep things minimal, we mainly focus on top-tier conferences in AI.

To add or update a deadline:
- Fork the repository
- Update [src/data/conferences.yml](src/data/conferences.yml)
- Make sure it has the `title`, `year`, `id`, `link`, `deadline`, `timezone`, `date`, `city`, `country`, `tags` attributes
    + See available timezone strings [here](https://momentjs.com/timezone/).
- Optionally add a `venue`, `note` and `abstract_deadline` in case this info is known
- Optionally add `hindex` (refers to h5-index from [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&vq=eng))
- Example:
    ```yaml
    - title: BestConf
      year: 2022
      id: bestconf22  # title as lower case + last two digits of year
      full_name: Best Conference for Anything  # full conference name
      link: link-to-website.com
      deadline: YYYY-MM-DD HH:SS
      abstract_deadline: YYYY-MM-DD HH:SS
      timezone: Asia/Seoul
